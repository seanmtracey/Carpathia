# Carpathia
An Electron-powered app for downloading your Vines to you computer.

## Vine is going away...
...and this makes me sad. I've almost 200 Vines taken over 3 years that I want to save, so I've made this app for myself (and others) to make getting at all those memories easier.

## Downloads
If you don't want to build the app yourself, there a pre-compiled versions for OS X and Linux (here)[https://github.com/seanmtracey/Carpathia/releases/]. Pick the version for your OS and run the app like you would any other.

## How to use
1. Download or build the app
2. Run the app.
3. Go to your Vine profile in a web browser
	* You can Google for yourself to find your profile
4. Copy the URL for your Vine profile and then paste it into Carpathia
5. Follow the onscreen instructions
6. Grab a tea. Downloading everything could take a while.
7. Enjoy
